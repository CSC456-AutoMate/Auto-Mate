The project's name is Automata, a project that allows us to create workflows to automate employees management paperwork. We used react vite for our front-end for fast server rendering and Flask for our back-end which is still not worked on yet. So at the moment the backend queries including login, register and auth are handled by firebase as well as the data storing.
